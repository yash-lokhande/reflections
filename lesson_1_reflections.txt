1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - We can directly get to the point wheres there is differece between two files,
    and this will help us to find the bug.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    - We can switch between any two older or newer versions.

3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    * Pros :
    - we can choose what should be the changes in new version.
    - It depends upon them when to make commits and hpw to commits

    * Cons :
    - In case we forget to commit, we can lose our changes.

4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    - Because those multiple files are connected with each others.

5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    - Git log is used to see the different commits to a repository
    - Git diff is used to see the differece between files i.e. we can see the additions (+)
    and subtractions (-)

6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    - By refering and checking out to different commits can let us find the bug in the file.

7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    - I want to try the Osdag project
